"This tutorial describes the :guilabel:`SCP` tool :ref:`edit_raster_tab` that"
" allows for the direct editing of pixel values in a raster. Direct editing "
"is very convenient in case of large rasters, reducing the computational time"
" and easing the process of updating a raster such as land cover "
"classification."

"In this tutorial we are going to edit a very large raster, which is the "
"**Corine Land Cover** referred to year 2006 (but it is available also for "

"Agency (EEA), and covers the whole European Countries with a spatial "
