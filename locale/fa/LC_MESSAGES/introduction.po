"Developed by `Luca Congedo "
"<http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luca_Congedo>`_, the **Semi-Automatic "
"Classification Plugin** (:guilabel:`SCP`) is a free open source plugin for "
"`QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`_ that allows for the semi-automatic "
"classification (also known as supervised classification) of remote sensing "
"images. It provides several tools for the download of free images, the "
"preprocessing, the postprocessing, and the raster calculation (please see "
":ref:`other_0`)."

"The **overall objective** of :guilabel:`SCP` is to provide a set of "
"intertwined tools for raster processing in order to make an automatic "
"workflow and ease the land cover classification, which could be performed "
"also by people whose main field is not remote sensing. The first version of "
"the :guilabel:`SCP` was written by Luca Congedo in 2012 for the `ACC Dar "
"Project <http://www.planning4adaptation.eu>`_ in order to create a tool for "
"the classification of land cover in an affordable and automatic fashion "
"(read this `working paper "
"<http://www.planning4adaptation.eu/Docs/events/WorkShopII/WorkingPaper_Activity2_1_complete.pdf>`_)."
" Following versions of :guilabel:`SCP` were developed as personal commitment"
" to the remote sensing field and open source software. :guilabel:`SCP` "
"version 5 (codename: Kourou) is developed in the frame of Luca Congedo's PhD"
" in Landscape and Environment at Sapienza University of Rome."
