msgid "The Semi-Automatic OS is based on `Debian <https://www.debian.org/>`_ , and it is designed to require very little hardware resources. It uses `LXDE <http://lxde.org/>`_ and `Openbox <http://openbox.org/>`_ as main desktop environment. This virtual machine can be useful for testing the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin, or when the installation of the required programs in the host system is problematic. |br| The Semi-Automatic OS is available as a 32 bit and 64 bit virtual machine that can be run in the open source VirtualBox, or any other virtualization program. The following is a guide for the installation of the Semi-Automatic OS in the open source program of virtualization VirtualBox."
