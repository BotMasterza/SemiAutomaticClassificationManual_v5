msgid "Developed by `Luca Congedo <http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luca_Congedo>`_, the **Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin** (:guilabel:`SCP`) is a free open source plugin for `QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`_ that allows for the semi-automatic classification (also known as supervised classification) of remote sensing images. It provides several tools for the download of free images, the preprocessing, the postprocessing, and the raster calculation (please see :ref:`other_0`)."

msgid "The **overall objective** of :guilabel:`SCP` is to provide a set of intertwined tools for raster processing in order to make an automatic workflow and ease the land cover classification, which could be performed also by people whose main field is not remote sensing. The first version of the :guilabel:`SCP` was written by Luca Congedo in 2012 for the `ACC Dar Project <http://www.planning4adaptation.eu>`_ in order to create a tool for the classification of land cover in an affordable and automatic fashion (read this `working paper <http://www.planning4adaptation.eu/Docs/events/WorkShopII/WorkingPaper_Activity2_1_complete.pdf>`_). Following versions of :guilabel:`SCP` were developed as personal commitment to the remote sensing field and open source software. :guilabel:`SCP` version 5 (codename: Kourou) is developed in the frame of Luca Congedo's PhD in Landscape and Environment at Sapienza University of Rome."
